    question: "How does the voice AI consultant work?",

    question: "How quickly will I receive a proposal?",

      "AI Discovery generates an instant blueprint. Manual form submissions and strategy calls typically receive a detailed proposal within 24–48 business hours, including pricing breakdown and implementation timeline.",

    question: "Is there any cost for the initial consultation?",

    question: "What should I prepare before a strategy call?",

      "Bring context on your team size, current tools (CRM, phone, email), biggest operational bottlenecks, and any automation you've already tried. Running AI Discovery first gives us a head start.",
